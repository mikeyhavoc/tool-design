# Tool-design

This is a page for my redesign of my tools page.
my goal is too redesign and try to make a better page 
design using bootstrap v.4.1.1, and javascript. 

## Goals

- Layout a better UI
- Try to create a better color scheme.
- Possibly a better critical css in the top half.
- work on the js functions to sort, group, items.
- possibly put a search bar for tools.
